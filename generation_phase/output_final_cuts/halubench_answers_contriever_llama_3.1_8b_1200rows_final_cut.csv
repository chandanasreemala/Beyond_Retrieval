Why populations may be particularly susceptible?,"due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and lack of access to education","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking why populations may be particularly susceptible, but it's not clear which population or context is being referred to. However, I can identify three different contexts in the provided text: Giardia duodenalis, human bitter taste receptors, and inflammatory bowel diseases.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information on the susceptibility of populations in each of the three contexts, but it's not clear which one the question is referring to. However, I can try to find a common thread among the three contexts.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
In the context of Giardia duodenalis, the population is susceptible to recombination between isolates from different assemblages, which can complicate the interpretation of multi-locus genotyping data. In the context of human bitter taste receptors, the population may be susceptible to toxic substances due to the diversity at tas2r genes. In the context of inflammatory bowel diseases, the population is susceptible to colitis due to genetic regions associated with susceptibility to trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.

However, the question is asking for a general reason why populations may be particularly susceptible. Based on the three contexts, it appears that populations may be particularly susceptible due to genetic factors, such as genetic diversity, genetic regions associated with susceptibility, or the presence of genetic variations that can affect their ability to respond to certain substances or diseases.

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.

"Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?",the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is perfect. The virus is not present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The context is a series of scientific articles discussing the molecular and serological investigation of 2019-nCOV infected patients, including the implication of multiple shedding routes. The question is whether oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection is sufficient.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information on the detection of 2019-nCOV in various samples, including oral swabs, anal swabs, and blood. It also discusses the limitations of using oral swabs for detection, particularly in cases where the virus is present in other bodily fluids or tissues.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
According to the articles, the presence of viral nucleotide can be found in anal swabs or blood even if it cannot be detected in oral swabs. In fact, the study found that more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmission through oral-fecal route. Additionally, the study suggests that patients who are viremic (i.e., have the virus in their blood) may not have positive swabs, which could lead to false negatives. Therefore, relying solely on oral swab detection may not be sufficient to confirm infection.

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
Based on the information provided, the answer is: No, oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection is not sufficient."

In the study on skeletal muscle reperfusion injury, morphological examination showed considerable oedema, disruption of muscle fibers, and infiltration of white cells into tissues. However, muscle nuclei did not show any morphological evidence of apoptosis and were negative for DNA fragmentation.

However, in the study on peplomycin-induced apoptosis in liver carcinoma cell line (bel-7402), apoptotic cells were detected using Hoechst 33258 staining, and confirmed by flow cytometric analysis and DNA fragmentation analysis. 

Considering the information from both studies, the morphological cell changes most associated with apoptosis are DNA fragmentation and cell shrinkage, which are not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, the study on peplomycin-induced apoptosis in liver carcinoma cell line (bel-7402) does mention that almost all the apoptosis occurred in cells undergoing the G1-phase after treatment for 24 h, but it does not explicitly mention the morphological changes associated with apoptosis.

However, the study on skeletal muscle reperfusion injury does mention that occasional neutrophils contained fragmented DNA, which is a morphological change associated with apoptosis.

Therefore, the morphological cell changes most associated with apoptosis are DNA fragmentation and cell shrinkage, but the context does not explicitly mention cell shrinkage. However, it does mention that occasional neutrophils contained fragmented DNA, which is a morphological change associated with apoptosis.

The final answer is: DNA fragmentation."

What could account for the dissemination of the 2019-nCOV virus across the whole body?,"We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa. Additionally, the virus is able to replicate in the liver, contributing to further dissemination and severity of the disease.","The text does not provide a detailed explanation of how the 2019-nCOV virus disseminates across the whole body. However, it mentions that coronaviruses can infect the human gastrointestinal tract, and faecal-oral transmission might play a role in the instance of 2019-nCOV. This suggests that the virus could potentially spread through the body through the gastrointestinal tract, but this is not explicitly stated as the primary mechanism of dissemination.

The text also mentions that transmission of respiratory viruses generally happens through large respiratory droplets, but some respiratory viruses can spread through fine particle aerosols, and indirect transmission via fomites can also play a role. This implies that the virus could potentially spread through the body through respiratory droplets or aerosols, but again, this is not explicitly stated as the primary mechanism of dissemination.

How many percent of people were not 40 to 49?,"81.8, 81.8","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The context is a collection of various statistics and information from different sources, including demographics, birth rates, and economic data from different regions and countries.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide information about the age distribution of the population of Syracuse, Italy, which is necessary to calculate the percentage of people not in the 40-49 age group.

However, we can find the information about the age distribution of the population of Syracuse in the provided text: ""the average age of syracuse resident is 40 compared to the italian average of 42.""

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the average age of a Syracuse resident is 40, we can assume that the population is evenly distributed around this age. However, we don't have the exact age distribution, so we can't calculate the exact percentage of people not in the 40-49 age group.

However, we can use the information about the percentage of minors (children ages 18 and younger) and pensioners (ages 65 and older) to estimate the percentage of people not in the 40-49 age group.

Minors (ages 0-17) = 18.87%
Pensioners (ages 65 and older) = 16.87%

We can assume that the remaining percentage of the population is between 18 and 64 years old, which includes the 40-49 age group.

Total percentage of minors and pensioners = 18.87% + 16.87% = 35.74%

Since the total population is 100%, we can subtract the percentage of minors and pensioners from 100% to get the percentage of people between 18 and 64 years old.

Percentage of people between 18 and 64 years old = 100% - 35.74% = 64.26%

Now, we need to subtract the percentage of people in the 40-49 age group from the percentage of people between 18 and 64 years old. However, we don't have the exact percentage of people in the 40-49 age group.

But we can assume that the percentage of people in the 40-49 age group is roughly equal to the percentage of people in the 40-49 age group in the Italian average, which is not provided.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide information about the number of households in the counties mentioned, but it does provide information about the population of some counties. However, it does provide information about the number of eligible voters in San Benito County, California, which can be used to estimate the number of households.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
According to the context, San Benito County has 34,562 eligible voters. Of those, 24,736 (71.57%) are registered voters. This means that there are at least 24,736 registered voters in the county. Assuming an average of 2-3 people per household, we can estimate the number of households in the county. However, the context does not provide a direct answer to the question.

However, we can look at the information provided for Bucks County, Pennsylvania. According to the context, as of the 2010 census, the population of Bucks County was 625,249.

"How many years separate the Great Turkish War, and the Fifteen Years War?","77, 77, 77, 77","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The context provides information about various wars, including the Long Turkish War, the Great Turkish War, and the Fifteen Years War. The question asks for the time difference between the Great Turkish War and the Fifteen Years War.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the dates for the Great Turkish War (1683-99) and the Fifteen Years War (reckoning from the 1591-92 Turkish campaign that captured Bihać). This information is sufficient to calculate the time difference between the two wars.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
The Great Turkish War started in 1683 and ended in 1699. The Fifteen Years War started in 1591. To find the time difference, we need to subtract the start year of the Fifteen Years War from the end year of the Great Turkish War, or the start year of the Great Turkish War from the end year of the Fifteen Years War. 

However, the end year of the Fifteen Years War is not provided in the text. The text only mentions that the Fifteen Years War was reckoned from the 1591-92 Turkish campaign that captured Bihać. It does not provide the end year of the Fifteen Years War. 

Since the end year of the Fifteen Years War is not provided, we can calculate the duration of the Great Turkish War and the Fifteen Years War. The Great Turkish War lasted for 16 years (from 1683 to 1699). The Fifteen Years War is reckoned from 1591-92, so it lasted for at least 15 years. However, the exact end year of the Fifteen Years War is not provided.

Since we cannot determine the exact end year of the Fifteen Years War, we cannot calculate the exact time difference between the two wars. However, we can calculate the time difference between the start year of the Great Turkish War and the start year of the Fifteen Years War. The Great Turkish War started in 1683, and the Fifteen Years War started in 1591. The time difference is 92 years.

However, it does provide the age distribution of adults in different age groups: 14.3% between 20 and 29, 12.2% between 30 and 39, 14.9% between 40 and 49, and 13.0% between 50 and 59. The senior population distribution is also provided.

To compare the adult population with the teenager population, we need to calculate the total adult population. The total population is not provided, but we can calculate the percentage of adults by adding the percentages of the adult age groups: 14.3% + 12.2% + 14.9% + 13.0% = 54.4%. This means that 54.4% of the population is adult.

However, the question is asking for the age distribution with the largest population, not the percentage. To determine this, we need to compare the number of teenagers (1,137) with the number of adults. Since the total population is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact number of adults. However, we can compare the percentage of teenagers (13.0%) with the combined percentage of adults (54.4%). Since 13.0% is less than 54.4%, the adult population is larger.

However, the question asks for the age distribution with the largest population, not the total population. The context does not provide the total population, but it does provide the percentage of teenagers (13.0%) and the combined percentage of adults (54.4%). Since 13.0% is less than 54.4%, the adult population is larger in terms of percentage. However, the question asks for the age distribution with the largest population, not the percentage.

The question asks for the FY2019 cash conversion cycle (CCC) for General Mills, which is defined as DIO + DSO - DPO. The definitions of DIO, DSO, and DPO are provided, and the necessary line items and information are shown within the income statement and the balance sheet.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

The context provides the necessary information to calculate the cash conversion cycle (CCC) for FY2019. The required line items and information are available in the balance sheet and income statement for FY2019 and FY2018.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

To calculate the cash conversion cycle (CCC), we need to calculate DIO, DSO, and DPO.

DIO is defined as: 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS).
- Average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 = (1,559.3 + 1,642.2) / 2 = 1,600.75
- FY2019 COGS = 11,496.7
- DIO = 365 * (1,600.75 / 11,496.7) = 53.19

DSO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue).
- Average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019 = (1,679.7 + 1,684.2) / 2 = 1,681.95
- FY2019 Revenue = 17,626.6
- DSO = 365 * (1,681.95 / 17,626.6) = 38.59

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019).
- Average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019 = (2,854.1 + 2,746.2) / 2 = 2,800.15

Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places.",7.78,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the FY2020 fixed asset turnover ratio for Nike, which can be calculated using the statement of financial position and the statement of income. The fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as FY2020 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2019 and FY2020).

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, including the property, plant and equipment (PP&E) for FY2019 and FY2020, and the net sales for FY2020. However, the context does not provide the net sales for FY2020 directly, but we can calculate it using the statement of cash flows.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, we need to calculate the average PP&E between FY2019 and FY2020, and the net sales for FY2020.

Average PP&E = (PP&E FY2019 + PP&E FY2020) / 2
= (3,989 + 4,454) / 2
= 4,221.5

To calculate the net sales for FY2020, we need to use the statement of cash flows. We can see that the cash provided by operations for FY2018 is $4,955 million, and the cash provided by operations for FY2017 is $3,846 million. We can assume that the net income for FY2018 is $1,933 million, and the net income for FY2017 is $4,240 million. We can also see that the depreciation for FY2018 is $747 million, and the depreciation for FY2017 is $706 million.

Using the statement of cash flows, we can calculate the net sales for FY2018 as follows:
Net sales FY2018 = Net income FY2018 + Depreciation FY2018 + Deferred income taxes FY2018
= $1,933 + $747 + $647
= $3,327 million

Similarly, we can calculate the net sales for FY2017 as follows:
Net sales FY2017 = Net income FY2017 + Depreciation FY2017 - Deferred income taxes FY2017
= $4,240 - $273 + $647
= $4,614 million

Since the net sales for FY2020 is not directly provided"
What is PG&E's FY2020 asset turnover ratio? Asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places. Compute or extract the answer by primarily using the details outlined in the balance sheet and the income statement.,0.2,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2020 asset turnover ratio of PG&E Corporation, which is defined as FY2020 revenue divided by the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the asset turnover ratio. We have the FY2020 revenue from the income statement and the total assets for FY2019 and FY2020 from the balance sheet.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the asset turnover ratio, we need to find the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020. 

First, we need to find the total assets for FY2019 and FY2020 from the balance sheet. 

For FY2019: Total liabilities and equity = $97,856
For FY2020: Total liabilities and equity = $118,644

Next, we need to find the average total assets between FY2019 and FY2020.
Average total assets = (Total liabilities and equity FY2019 + Total liabilities and equity FY2020) / 2
= ($97,856 + $118,644) / 2
= $108,250

Now, we need to find the FY2020 revenue from the income statement.
FY2020 revenue = $17,129 (electric) + $4,389 (natural gas) = $21,518

Finally, we can calculate the asset turnover ratio.
Asset turnover ratio = FY2020 revenue / Average total assets
= $21,518 / $108,250
= 0.20

Rounded to two decimal places, the asset turnover ratio is 0.20."
What is the FY2020 fixed asset turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson? Fixed asset turnover ratio is defined as: FY2020 revenue / (average PP&E between FY2019 and FY2020). Round your answer to two decimal places. Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the statement of income and the statement of financial position.,4.53,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2020 fixed asset turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson, which is defined as FY2020 revenue divided by the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between FY2019 and FY2020.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, including the FY2020 revenue and the PP&E for FY2019 and FY2020.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, we need to find the average PP&E between FY2019 and FY2020. 

The PP&E for FY2019 is $18,962 million and for FY2020 is $19,803 million. 

Average PP&E = (PP&E FY2019 + PP&E FY2020) / 2
= ($18,962 + $19,803) / 2
= $19,382.5 million

The FY2020 revenue is $94,943 million.

Fixed asset turnover ratio = FY2020 revenue / Average PP&E
= $94,943 / $19,382.5
= 4.90

The FY2020 fixed asset turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson is 4.90."
We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the balance sheet. Here's the question: what is FY2022 net working capital for Walmart? Define net working capital as total current assets less total current liabilities. Answer in USD millions.,-$6308.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks to calculate the FY2022 net working capital for Walmart, which is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated balance sheets for Walmart as of January 31, 2022, which includes the necessary information to calculate net working capital.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate net working capital, we need to subtract total current liabilities from total current assets for the year 2022.

Total current assets for 2022: $81,070 million
Total current liabilities for 2022: $87,379 million

Net working capital = Total current assets - Total current liabilities
Net working capital = $81,070 million - $87,379 million
Net working capital = -$6,309 million

However, since net working capital cannot be negative, it seems there is an error in the calculation. Let's recheck the numbers.

Total current assets for 2022: $81,070 million
Total current liabilities for 2022: $87,379 million

Since the total current liabilities are more than the total current assets, the net working capital is actually negative. However, the question asks for the amount in USD millions, and the negative sign is not part of the answer. The correct answer is the absolute value of the result.

The absolute value of -$6,309 million is $6,309 million.

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
The final answer is $6,309."
"From the perspective of a public equities analyst, please answer the following question by primarily taking information that is provided in the balance sheet. What is the year end FY2021 total assets for PepsiCo? Answer in USD millions.",$92377.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the year-end total assets for PepsiCo in FY2021, which can be found in the balance sheet.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the balance sheet for PepsiCo for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020. The balance sheet includes the total equity and noncontrolling interests, but it does not directly provide the total assets.

However, we can find the total assets by adding the total equity and noncontrolling interests to the total liabilities.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To find the total assets for FY2021, we need to find the total liabilities and add it to the total equity and noncontrolling interests.

From the balance sheet for FY2021, we can see that the total equity is $16,151 million and the noncontrolling interests is $108 million.

However, we need to find the total liabilities to add to the total equity and noncontrolling interests.

Looking at the balance sheet for FY2021, we can see that the total liabilities is not directly provided. But we can find the total liabilities by subtracting the total equity and noncontrolling interests from the total assets.

Looking at the balance sheet for FY2021, we can see that the total equity and noncontrolling interests is $16,151 + $108 = $16,259 million.

However, we need to find the total assets for FY2021.

Looking at the balance sheet for FY2022, we can see that the total equity is $17,273 million and the noncontrolling interests is $124 million.

We can also see that the total liabilities for FY2022 is $17,273 + $124 = $17,397 million.

Now, looking at the balance sheet for FY2021, we can see that the total equity and noncontrolling interests is $16,151 + $108 = $16,259 million.

Since the total liabilities for FY2022 is $17,397 million and the total equity and noncontrolling interests for FY2022 is $17,273 million, we can assume that the total liabilities for FY2021 is also $17,397 million.

Now, we can find the total assets for FY2021 by adding the total liabilities"

The question asks for the year-end FY2021 total amount of inventories for Costco, which can be found in the statement of cash flows.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the statement of cash flows for the 52 weeks ended September 3, 2017, September 2, 2018, and September 1, 2019. However, it also mentions the 53 weeks ended September 3, 2017, but the year-end date for FY2021 is not explicitly mentioned. The statement of cash flows for FY2021 is not directly provided, but we can infer that the year-end date for FY2021 is December 31, 2021.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the statement of cash flows for FY2021 is not directly provided, we need to look for a related information that can help us calculate the year-end FY2021 total amount of inventories. The statement of cash flows for FY2019 mentions the change in operating assets and liabilities, which includes merchandise inventories. However, this information is not directly applicable to FY2021.

Upon reviewing the statement of cash flows for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019, we can see that the change in merchandise inventories is provided for each year. We can use this information to estimate the year-end FY2021 total amount of inventories.

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
To estimate the year-end FY2021 total amount of inventories, we can use the change in merchandise inventories for FY2018 and FY2019. The change in merchandise inventories for FY2018 is -$1,313 million, and for FY2019 is -$536 million. We can assume that the change in merchandise inventories for FY2021 is similar to the average of the changes in FY2018 and FY2019.

Average change in merchandise inventories = (-$1,313 million - $536 million) / 2 = -$924.5 million

Since the change in merchandise inventories is -$924.5 million, we can add this to the beginning of year inventory to get the year-end inventory for FY2021.

Beginning of year inventory for FY2021 is not provided, but we can use the beginning of year"

The context is a financial statement of a company, likely AMD, providing information about their income taxes, effective tax rates, and other financial metrics. The question asks for the change in COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) margin for the fiscal year 2021 to 2022.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide information about COGS or COGS margin directly. However, it does provide information about net sales and operating profit of business segments, which might be used to calculate COGS margin.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the context does not provide COGS directly, we can use the information about net sales and operating profit to calculate COGS margin. However, we need to make an assumption that the net sales and operating profit provided are for the entire company, not just segments. 

We can use the formula: COGS Margin = (1 - (Operating Profit / Net Sales)) * 100

We can calculate the COGS margin for FY2021 and FY2022 using the provided data:

FY2021: Operating Profit = $6,802 - $6,523 = $279 (this is the provision for income taxes, which is the opposite of net income, so we need to subtract it from the provision for income taxes to get the operating profit)
FY2021: Net Sales = Not provided, but we can use the information about the effective tax rate to infer that the net income is $6,802 * (1 - 0.231) = $5,313. 
However, we cannot calculate the net sales from the given information. We can only calculate the COGS margin using the provided operating profit and provision for income taxes.

FY2022: Operating Profit = $6,802 - $6,523 = $279 (same as FY2021)
FY2022: Net Sales = Not provided, same as FY2021.

Since we cannot calculate the net sales, we cannot calculate the COGS margin directly. However, we can calculate the change in COGS margin using the provided information.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we need to first find the growth rate from FY2018 to FY2019 and then from FY2019 to FY2020.

The total revenue for FY2018 is $101,127 million, for FY2019 is $76,559 million, and for FY2020 is $58,158 million.

The growth rate from FY2018 to FY2019 is ((76,559 - 101,127) / 101,127) * 100% ≈ -24.3%.
The growth rate from FY2019 to FY2020 is ((58,158 - 76,559) / 76,559) * 100% ≈ -24.1%.

However, the question asks for the 2-year CAGR, which is the growth rate over two years. To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we need to use the formula: CAGR = (FV / PV)^(1/n) - 1, where FV is the future value, PV is the present value, and n is the number of years.

We can use the total revenues for FY2018 and FY2020 as the present and future values, respectively, and n = 2.

CAGR = (58,158 / 101,127)^(1/2) - 1 ≈ -0.421 or -42.1%.

Rounded to one decimal place, the 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2018 to FY2020 is -42.1%.

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The 2-year total revenue CAGR from FY2018 to FY2020 is -42.1%."
What is the FY2019 - FY2021 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for AMD? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of income and the statement of cash flows.,3.1%,"To calculate the 3-year average of Capex as a % of revenue for AMD, we need to first determine the Capex for each year and the revenue for each year. However, the provided context does not mention Capex directly. It mentions net cash used in financing activities, provision for income taxes, and net sales and operating profit of business segments, but not Capex.

The context does mention net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, which is $534 million, but this is not directly related to Capex. It also mentions that the primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities include the proceeds from, and repayments of, our long-term debt and transactions involving our common stock, but this does not provide information about Capex.

The context also mentions the provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, but this information is not relevant to calculating Capex as a % of revenue.

The context does mention net sales and operating profit of business segments, but it excludes intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. This information is not sufficient to calculate revenue.

Since the context does not provide sufficient information to calculate Capex for each year, we cannot determine the 3-year average of Capex as a % of revenue for AMD."

What was MSFT's diluted EPS growth from FY2021 to FY2022?,0.35%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the diluted EPS growth of MSFT from FY2021 to FY2022.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the diluted EPS for FY2021 ($1.03) and FY2022 ($0.32) on a continuing operations basis, but it seems to be incorrect as the diluted EPS for FY2022 is lower than FY2021. However, it also provides the non-GAAP EPS for FY2022 ($1.03) which is the same as FY2021. The context also provides dividend payments for FY2021 and FY2022, but it does not provide the net income or revenue for the respective years.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the diluted EPS for FY2022 is not provided, we can use the non-GAAP EPS for FY2022 ($1.03) and FY2021 ($1.03) to calculate the growth. However, this is not the correct diluted EPS for FY2022. The correct approach would be to find the net income for FY2021 and FY2022 and then calculate the diluted EPS. Unfortunately, the context does not provide the net income for the respective years.

However, we can use the dividend payments to estimate the growth. The dividend per share has increased from $10.60 in FY2021 to $11.40 in FY2022, which is an increase of $0.80 or 7.55%. This increase in dividend per share may indicate the growth in earnings per share.

The context doesn’t provide sufficient information to accurately calculate the diluted EPS growth from FY2021 to FY2022."
What is Costco's FY2016 unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement (unadjusted EBITDA) in USD millions? Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,$4928.00,"To find Costco's FY2016 unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement (unadjusted EBITDA), we need to first determine the fiscal year 2016 data from the provided statements.

The provided statements are for the fiscal years ended September 1, 2019, September 2, 2018, and September 3, 2017. Since the fiscal year 2016 data is not directly available, we need to find the fiscal year 2017 data and then subtract the difference between the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 from the fiscal year 2017 data to estimate the fiscal year 2016 data.

From the statement of income for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, we can see that the fiscal year 2017 data is available. We will use this data to estimate the fiscal year 2016 data.

The statement of income for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, shows the following data for the fiscal year 2017:

- Operating income: $5,435 million
- Depreciation and amortization: $1,370 million

The statement of income for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022, shows the following data for the fiscal year 2018:

- Operating income: $6,708 million
- Depreciation and amortization: $1,437 million

The statement of income for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2022, shows the following data for the fiscal year 2019:

- Operating income: $7,793 million
- Depreciation and amortization: $1,492 million

To estimate the fiscal year 2016 data, we will calculate the difference between the fiscal year 2017 and 2018, and the difference between the fiscal year 2018 and 2019, and then use these differences to estimate the fiscal year 2016 data.

The difference between the fiscal year 2017 and 2018 is:
- Operating income: $6,708 - $5,435 = $1,273 million
- Depreciation and amortization: $1,437 - $1,370 = $67 million

The difference between the fiscal year 2018 and 2019 is:
- Operating income: $7,793 - $6,708 = $1,085 million
- Depreciation and amortization: $1,492 - $1,437 = $55"

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
- The context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

To calculate the cash conversion cycle (CCC), we need to calculate DIO, DSO, and DPO.

DIO is defined as: 365 * (average inventory between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS).
- Average inventory between FY2019 and FY2020 = (3,619 + 2,997) / 2 = 3,308
- FY2020 COGS = 48,996
- DIO = 365 * (3,308) / 48,996 = 24.51

DSO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 Revenue).
- Average accounts receivable between FY2019 and FY2020 = (2,337 + 2,444) / 2 = 2,390.5
- FY2020 Revenue = 65,398
- DSO = 365 * (2,390.5) / 65,398 = 17.19

DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020).
- Average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020 = (1,281 + 2,402) / 2 = 1,841.5
- Change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020 = 2,997 - 3,619 = -622
- FY2020 COGS = 48,996
- DPO = 365 * (1,841.5) / (48,996 - 622) = 14.19

Now, we can calculate the cash conversion cycle (CCC) as: DIO + DSO - DPO.

The question asks for the 2-year total revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of General Mills from FY2015 to FY2017, using information from the income statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the net sales data for General Mills for the years FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017. This information is sufficient to calculate the 2-year CAGR.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we need to first find the growth rate between FY2015 and FY2016, and then the growth rate between FY2016 and FY2017.

The net sales for FY2015 is $17,630.3 million, for FY2016 is $16,563.1 million, and for FY2017 is $15,619.8 million.

The growth rate between FY2015 and FY2016 is ((16,563.1 - 17,630.3) / 17,630.3) * 100% ≈ -5.9%

The growth rate between FY2016 and FY2017 is ((15,619.8 - 16,563.1) / 16,563.1) * 100% ≈ -5.8%

To find the 2-year CAGR, we need to find the average of the two growth rates. However, since the growth rates are negative, we need to use the formula for compound growth rate for a negative growth rate, which is (1 + r1) * (1 + r2) - 1, where r1 and r2 are the growth rates.

First, we need to convert the growth rates to decimal form: -5.9% = -0.059 and -5.8% = -0.058.

Then, we can calculate the 2-year CAGR: (1 - 0.059) * (1 - 0.058) - 1 ≈ -5.9%

However, this is the average of the two growth rates, not the compound annual growth rate. To find the compound annual growth rate, we need to use the formula: ((FV/P)^(1/n) - 1), where FV is the future value, P is the present value, and n is the number"

From the statement of cash flows, we can find the COGS by looking at the ""cost of sales"" line in the income statement, which is not directly provided. However, we can find the net sales and then subtract the COGS from the net sales to find the COGS. Unfortunately, the net sales for FY2018 is not provided in the statement of cash flows. However, we can find the net income including non-controlling interests for FY2018, which is $3,179 million.

Step 2: Find the net sales for FY2018.

The gross margin is the difference between the net income including non-controlling interests and the depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, other non-cash operating activities, net, deferred income taxes, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Gross margin = Net income including non-controlling interests + Depreciation and amortization + Stock-based compensation + Other non-cash operating activities, net + Deferred income taxes + Changes in operating assets and liabilities
Gross margin = $3,179 + $1,437 + $544 + ($6) + ($49) + ($1,313 - $322 + $421)
Gross margin = $3,179 + $1,437 + $544 - $6 - $49 - $1,313 + $322 + $421
Gross margin = $4,313

What is the FY2015 - FY2017 total revenue 2 year CAGR for PepsiCo? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the income statement.,0.5%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2015 - FY2017 total revenue 2-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for PepsiCo, assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the income statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the total revenue for FY2015, FY2016, and FY2017, which are $63,056 million, $62,799 million, and $62,799 million, respectively. This information is sufficient to calculate the 2-year CAGR.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we can use the formula:

CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1

In this case, the beginning value is the FY2015 revenue, the ending value is the FY2017 revenue, and the number of years is 2.

CAGR = ($62,799 / $63,056)^(1 / 2) - 1

CAGR ≈ 0.9985 - 1 ≈ -0.1%

However, this is the CAGR from FY2015 to FY2017. To get the 2-year CAGR, we need to calculate the CAGR from FY2014 to FY2016 and then multiply it by the CAGR from FY2015 to FY2017.

First, let's calculate the CAGR from FY2014 to FY2016:

CAGR = ($62,799 / $66,683)^(1 / 2) - 1
CAGR ≈ 0.9435 - 1 ≈ -5.65%

Now, let's multiply this CAGR by the CAGR from FY2015 to FY2017:

(-5.65%) * (-0.1%) ≈ 0.566%

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.

Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by adopting the perspective of a financial analyst who can only use the details shown within the P&L statement and the balance sheet.,57.23,"To calculate Corning's FY2021 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need to follow the given formula: 

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2020 and FY2021) / (FY2021 COGS + change in inventory between FY2020 and FY2021)

Step 1: Calculate the average accounts payable between FY2020 and FY2021.
From the consolidated balance sheets, we can see that the accounts payable for FY2020 is $1,587 million and for FY2021 is $1,612 million. 

Average accounts payable = ($1,587 million + $1,612 million) / 2 = $1,599.5 million

Step 2: Calculate the change in inventory between FY2020 and FY2021.
From the consolidated balance sheets, we can see that the inventory for FY2020 is $2,320 million and for FY2021 is $2,481 million.

Change in inventory = $2,481 million - $2,320 million = $161 million

Step 3: Calculate the FY2021 COGS.
From the consolidated statements of cash flows, we can see that the depreciation is $1,352 million, amortization of purchased intangibles is $129 million, loss on disposal of assets is $57 million, and other items are not directly related to COGS. However, we can calculate the COGS by looking at the change in inventory and the cost of goods sold in the cash flow statement.

COGS = Change in inventory + Other items (not directly related to COGS) + Depreciation + Amortization of purchased intangibles + Loss on disposal of assets
COGS = $161 million + $57 million + $1,352 million + $129 million + $57 million = $1,656 million

Step 4: Calculate the DPO.
DPO = 365 * ($1,599.5 million) / ($1,656 million + $161 million)
DPO = 365 * ($1,599.5 million) / $1,817 million
DPO = 365 * 0.881
DPO = 321.465

Rounded to two decimal places, the DPO is 321.47."

However, it mentions that net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $534 million, but this information is not relevant to the question. The context also mentions the provision for income taxes for FY2022, but this is also not relevant to the question.

However, the context does provide the depreciation and amortization expense for FY2018 and FY2017, but not for FY2022. We need to find the depreciation and amortization expense for FY2022.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
The context mentions that net cash used in financing activities decreased by $803 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower repayments of short-term borrowings and long-term debt of $773 million.

The question asks for the FY2019 working capital ratio for Johnson & Johnson, which is defined as the total current assets divided by the total current liabilities. The context provides the consolidated balance sheets for Johnson & Johnson at January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021, but it also mentions the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated balance sheets for 2022 and 2021, but it does not provide the balance sheet for 2019. However, it provides the consolidated statements of cash flows for 2020, 2019, and 2018, which include the net income and other relevant information. Since the working capital ratio is calculated using the balance sheet data, we need the balance sheet for 2019 to calculate the working capital ratio for FY2019.

How did Corning's net cash provided by financing activities compare in 2022 versus 2021?,Net cash provided by financing activities increased by $803Mn from 2021 to 2022.,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The context is about Corning's financial statements, including their consolidated balance sheets and the drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities. The question asks for a comparison of Corning's net cash provided by financing activities in 2022 versus 2021.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information about Corning's net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, which was $534 million. It also mentions that net cash used in financing activities decreased by $803 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period last year. This implies that the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was $1,337 million ($534 million + $803 million).

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the context mentions that net cash used in financing activities decreased by $803 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, we can infer that the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was $1,337 million ($534 million + $803 million). However, the question asks for the comparison of net cash provided by financing activities, not used. Since the context only provides information about net cash used in financing activities, we cannot directly determine the net cash provided by financing activities for 2021. However, we can infer that the net cash provided by financing activities for 2022 was negative ($534 million), and the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was $1,337 million, which is also negative. Therefore, the net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.

However, the question asks for the comparison of net cash provided by financing activities, not used. Since the context only provides information about net cash used in financing activities, we cannot directly determine the net cash provided by financing activities for 2021. But we can infer that the net cash provided by financing activities for 2022 was negative ($534 million), and the net cash used in financing activities for 2021 was $1,337 million, which is also negative. Therefore, the net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.

We want to calculate a financial metric. Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the income statement. Here's the question: what is Verizon's FY2019 net profit margin as a percentage?,15.2%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for Verizon's FY2019 net profit margin as a percentage, which can be calculated using the income statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the income statement for Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The income statement includes the necessary information to calculate the net profit margin.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the net profit margin, we need to use the following formula: Net Profit Margin = (Net Income / Total Revenue) * 100.

From the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019, we can find the following values:
- Net Income: $19,788 million
- Total Revenue: $131,868 million

Now, we can plug these values into the formula to calculate the net profit margin:
Net Profit Margin = ($19,788 / $131,868) * 100

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
Net Profit Margin = ($19,788 / $131,868) * 100 ≈ 15.0%"
"Assuming you only had access to the statement of cash flows, please answer the following question: what is the FY2022 D&A expense amount (in USD millions) for AMD?",$4074.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the FY2022 D&A (Depreciation and Amortization) expense amount for AMD, and we only have access to the statement of cash flows.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information about the weighted average useful lives of intangible assets, which is relevant to calculating D&A expense. It also mentions that net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $534 million, but this information is not directly related to D&A expense.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate D&A expense, we need to use the information about the weighted average useful lives of intangible assets. We know that the weighted average useful lives are as follows: customer contracts and relationships 10 years, purchased technology 5 years, trademarks 9 years, and other 4 years. However, we don't have the total amount of intangible assets or the D&A expense directly.

Since we don't have the total amount of intangible assets, we can't directly calculate the D&A expense. However, we can use the information about the principal payments on outstanding debt to infer that the context is discussing a company's financial situation, and the D&A expense is likely related to the intangible assets.

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
The context doesn’t provide sufficient information to calculate the FY2022 D&A expense amount for AMD."

Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.",0.1%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.

The question is asking for the change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin from FY2015 to FY2016 for Costco, and to calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A from the cash flow statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

The context does not provide information about Costco's FY2015 and FY2016 financial data, such as operating income, D&A, and net sales. However, it does provide information about the company's effective tax rate and adjusted effective tax rate for FY2023 and FY2022, as well as some general information about the company's business and financial trends.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

Since the context does not provide sufficient information about Costco's FY2015 and FY2016 financial data, we cannot calculate the change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin for those years.

However, we can try to find the information we need by looking for any clues in the provided text. Unfortunately, there is no information about FY2015 and FY2016 in the provided text.

The question asks for the operating cash flow ratio of Netflix for FY2017, which is defined as cash from operations divided by total current liabilities.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the operating cash flow ratio for FY2017. The cash flow statement for FY2017 shows the net cash used in operating activities, and the consolidated balance sheet for FY2017 shows the total current liabilities.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
From the cash flow statement for FY2017, the net cash used in operating activities is $1,785,948,000. From the consolidated balance sheet for FY2017, the total current liabilities are $4,586,657,000.

The question is asking for the net accounts receivable of Coca Cola at the end of FY2020.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the balance sheet for Coca Cola for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes the information on net accounts receivable.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
The balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2020, shows the following information for net accounts receivable:
Trade accounts receivable, less allowances of $526 and $524, respectively: $3,144 and $3,971.

Since the question asks for the net accounts receivable, we need to subtract the allowance for doubtful accounts from the trade accounts receivable. However, the allowance for doubtful accounts is the same in both cases ($526 and $524), so we can use either value. 

To find the net accounts receivable, we subtract the allowance from the trade accounts receivable: $3,144 - $526 = $2,618.

However, the question asks for the net accounts receivable, which is the trade accounts receivable minus the allowance. The trade accounts receivable is $3,144, and the allowance is $526. The net accounts receivable is $3,144 - $526 = $2,618."
"We need to calculate a reasonable approximation (or exact number if possible) of a financial metric. Basing your judgment by information plainly provided in the cash flow statement and the P&L statement, what is the FY2019 depreciation and amortization (D&A from cash flow statement) % margin for Coca Cola?",3.7%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2019 depreciation and amortization (D&A) % margin for Coca Cola, based on the information provided in the cash flow statement and the P&L statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the P&L statement for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, but it does not provide the P&L statement for the year 2019. However, it does provide the cash flow statement, which includes the depreciation and amortization (D&A) for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the P&L statement for 2019 is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the D&A % margin for 2019. However, we can use the information from the cash flow statement to estimate the D&A for 2019. The cash flow statement for 2020, 2021, and 2022 shows the following D&A:

- 2022: $2,444 million
- 2021: $2,444 million
- 2020: $2,444 million

Since the D&A is the same for 2021 and 2022, we can assume that it was also the same for 2020. However, we cannot assume that it was the same for 2019. To estimate the D&A for 2019, we need to look at the trend of the net income and the gross profit margin.

From the P&L statement, we can see that the gross profit margin for 2020, 2021, and 2022 is:

- 2022: 58.1% (25,004 / 43,004)
- 2021: 59.4% (23,298 / 38,655)
- 2020: 59.1% (19,581 / 33,014)

The gross profit margin has been increasing over the years, which suggests that the D&A has been decreasing as a percentage of sales. Assuming a similar trend for 2019, we can estimate the D&A for 2019.

The net income for 2020, 2021, and 2022 is:

- 2022: $9,419 million

The question asks for the FY2022 net interest expense for PG&E, and we need to find this information in the provided context, primarily in the income statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated balance sheets for PG&E as of December 31, 2022, and information about the primary drivers of net cash flows associated with financing activities. However, it does not directly provide the income statement for FY2022, which typically includes the net interest expense.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Although the income statement is not directly provided, we can infer that the net interest expense is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can use the information from the balance sheets to estimate the interest expense. The long-term debt is $47,742 million as of December 31, 2022, and the interest payable is $626 million. We can assume that the interest payable is a portion of the total interest expense for the year.

Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the income statement and the cash flow statement.,5.3%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.

The question asks for the change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin from FY2019 to FY2020 for Netflix. To calculate this, we need to first calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for both years using the information from the cash flow statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

The context provides the necessary information to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for both years. We can use the cash flow statement to find the operating income and depreciation and amortization (D&A) for both years.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA, we need to add the operating income and D&A from the cash flow statement.

For FY2019:
- Operating income: $5,116,228
- D&A: $12,230,367 + $208,412 = $12,438,779
- Unadjusted EBITDA: $5,116,228 + $12,438,779 = $17,554,007

For FY2020:
- Operating income: $2,761,395
- D&A: $10,806,912 + $115,710 = $10,922,622
- Unadjusted EBITDA: $2,761,395 + $10,922,622 = $13,684,017

To calculate the EBITDA % margin, we need to divide the unadjusted EBITDA by the revenue and multiply by 100.

For FY2019:
- Revenue: Not provided in the context, but we can use the net income as a proxy for revenue. 
- EBITDA % margin: ($17,554,007 / Net Income) * 100 = ($17,554,007 / $5,116,228) * 100 = 343.3%

For FY2020:
- Revenue: Not provided in the context, but we can use the net income as a proxy for revenue. 
- EBITDA % margin: ($13,684,017 / Net Income) * 100 = ($13,684,017 / $2,761,395) * 100 = 494.5%

To find the change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin, we subtract the FY2019 EBITDA % margin from the FY2020 EBITDA % margin.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the FY2016 revenue and the average total assets between FY2015 and FY2016. The FY2016 revenue can be found in the statement of income, and the total assets for FY2015 and FY2016 can be found in the statement of financial position.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the FY2016 asset turnover ratio, we need to find the FY2016 revenue and the average total assets between FY2015 and FY2016.

The FY2016 revenue can be found in the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is $5,720,291,000.

The total assets for FY2015 can be found in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2015, which is $13,586,610,000.

The total assets for FY2016 can be found in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2016, which is $19,012,742,000.

To find the average total assets between FY2015 and FY2016, we need to add the total assets for FY2015 and FY2016 and divide by 2.

Average total assets = (13,586,610,000 + 19,012,742,000) / 2
Average total assets = 16,299,676,000

Now, we can calculate the FY2016 asset turnover ratio by dividing the FY2016 revenue by the average total assets.

FY2016 asset turnover ratio = FY2016 revenue / average total assets
FY2016 asset turnover ratio = 5,720,291,000 / 16,299,676,000
FY2016 asset turnover ratio = 0.35

What is FY2019 days sales outstanding (DSO) for Best Buy? DSO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue). Round your answer to two decimal places. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,8.78,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the FY2019 days sales outstanding (DSO) for a company, but the provided context does not mention the company name as Best Buy. However, it seems to be discussing Pfizer's financial information. The question asks for DSO, which is a metric that can be calculated using the balance sheet and P&L statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information about Pfizer's financial performance, including revenue and dividend payments, but it does not provide information about the company's accounts receivable or the specific financial metrics for Best Buy. However, it does provide information about Pfizer's revenue for FY2019, which might be useful for calculating DSO.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

What is the FY2019 - FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA (using unadjusted operating income + D&A from cash flow statement) 2 year CAGR for MGM Resorts? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of cash flows and the P&L statement.,-18.9%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.

The question asks for the FY2019 - FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA (using unadjusted operating income + D&A from cash flow statement) 2-year CAGR for MGM Resorts.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

The context provides the necessary information to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for FY2019 and FY2020, as well as the necessary information to calculate the 2-year CAGR.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

From the statement of cash flows, we can extract the depreciation and amortization (D&A) for FY2019 and FY2020:

- FY2019: $1,304,649
- FY2020: $1,210,556

From the P&L statement, we can extract the operating income for FY2019 and FY2020:

- FY2019: $3,940,215
- FY2020: $1,469,486

We can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for FY2019 and FY2020 by adding the D&A to the operating income:

- FY2019: $3,940,215 + $1,304,649 = $5,244,864
- FY2020: $1,469,486 + $1,210,556 = $2,680,042

To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we can use the formula:

CAGR = (FY2020 EBITDA / FY2019 EBITDA)^(1/2) - 1

CAGR = ($2,680,042 / $5,244,864)^(1/2) - 1 ≈ 0.476 or 47.6%

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.

The context does not provide sufficient information to directly calculate the FY2016 return on assets (ROA) for Best Buy, as it does not include the necessary data for FY2015 and FY2016, such as net income and average total assets.

However, we can infer that the context does not provide the necessary information for FY2016, but it does provide information for FY2023, FY2022, and FY2021. We can also find the information for FY2015 in the context, but it is not directly related to the question.

The question asks for the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2020 to FY2021 for PepsiCo, expressed as a percentage.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the income statements for FY2020, FY2019, and FY2018. The income statement for FY2020 and FY2019 includes the operating income for both years.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To find the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income, we need to calculate the percentage change from FY2020 to FY2019. 

Operating income for FY2020 is $10,080 million.
Operating income for FY2019 is $10,291 million.

The year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income is calculated as follows:
((Operating income FY2020 - Operating income FY2019) / Operating income FY2019) * 100
= (($10,080 - $10,291) / $10,291) * 100

The question asks for the FY2021 - FY2022 change in unadjusted operating income % margin for MGM Resorts.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the income statements for FY2021 and FY2022, which include the revenues and operating income for both years. This information is sufficient to calculate the operating income % margin for both years and the change in the margin.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the operating income % margin, we need to divide the operating income by the revenues and multiply by 100.

For FY2021:
Operating income = $2,278,699
Revenues = $9,680,140
Operating income % margin = (Operating income / Revenues) * 100 = (2,278,699 / 9,680,140) * 100 = 23.5%

For FY2022:
Operating income = $1,254,370
Revenues = $9,680,140
Operating income % margin = (Operating income / Revenues) * 100 = (1,254,370 / 9,680,140) * 100 = 12.9%

To find the change in the operating income % margin, we subtract the FY2022 margin from the FY2021 margin:
Change in operating income % margin = FY2021 margin - FY2022 margin = 23.5% - 12.9% = 10.6%

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The change in unadjusted operating income % margin for MGM Resorts from FY2021 to FY2022 is 10.6%."

The question asks for the FY2018 fixed asset turnover ratio for Johnson & Johnson, which is defined as FY2018 revenue divided by the average property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) between FY2017 and FY2018.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information: the statement of income for FY2018 and the statement of financial position for FY2017 and FY2018.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the fixed asset turnover ratio, we need to find the FY2018 revenue and the average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018.

- FY2018 revenue is found in the statement of income: $81,581 million.
- PP&E for FY2017 is found in the statement of financial position: $17,005 million.
- PP&E for FY2018 is found in the statement of financial position: $17,035 million.

To find the average PP&E, we add the PP&E for FY2017 and FY2018 and divide by 2:
Average PP&E = ($17,005 + $17,035) / 2 = $17,020 million

What was MGM's interest coverage ratio using FY2022 Adjusted EBIT as the numerator and annual Interest Expense as the denominator?,"As adjusted EBIT is negative, coverage ratio is zero","To calculate the interest coverage ratio, we need to determine the Adjusted EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) for FY2022 and the annual Interest Expense for FY2022.

From the provided financial statements, we can find the necessary information as follows:

1. Adjusted EBIT for FY2022:
   - Operating income (loss) for FY2022 is $2,278,699.
   - Depreciation and amortization for FY2022 is $1,150,610.
   - We need to add these two numbers to get the Adjusted EBIT for FY2022.

2. Annual Interest Expense for FY2022:
   - Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized for FY2022 is $799,593.

Now, we can calculate the interest coverage ratio using the formula:
Interest Coverage Ratio = Adjusted EBIT / Annual Interest Expense
Interest Coverage Ratio = $3,429,309 / $799,593
Interest Coverage Ratio ≈ 4.29

The final answer is 4.29."

The context provides information about the company's financial performance, including net sales, operating profit, cash flow, debt, dividend payments, and restricted stock vesting. The question asks for the 3-year average of Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) as a percentage of revenue for the years FY2019 to FY2021.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide explicit information about the company's revenue for FY2019 to FY2021, nor does it provide explicit information about the Depreciation and Amortization (D&A) for these years. However, it does provide information about the net sales and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the total fair value of time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the context does not provide explicit information about the revenue for FY2019 to FY2021, we cannot directly calculate the D&A as a percentage of revenue for these years. However, we can infer that the context is related to AMD, but the information provided is for the year ended December 31, 2022, and the years 2021 and 2020. We can look for information that might be indirectly related to the answer.

The context mentions that the net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. However, this information is not directly relevant to the question.

What is FY2019 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Amazon? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019). Round your answer to two decimal places. Please utilize information provided primarily within the statement of financial position and the income statement.,92.27,"To calculate the FY2019 days payable outstanding (DPO) for Amazon, we need to gather the necessary information from the provided financial statements.

Step 1: Identify the required information.
- Average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019
- FY2019 COGS
- Change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019

Step 2: Analyze the provided financial statements to gather the required information.
- The statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 is provided, but it does not include the information for FY2018 and FY2019.
- The statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022 is provided, but it does not include the information for FY2018 and FY2019.
- However, we can infer that the COGS for FY2019 can be calculated by subtracting the change in inventory from the net sales for FY2019.

Step 3: Calculate the COGS for FY2019.
- Net sales for FY2018 is $386,064 million and for FY2019 is $469,822 million. The change in net sales is $83,758 million.
- Assuming the change in net sales is primarily due to the change in COGS, we can estimate the COGS for FY2019 as follows:
  COGS for FY2019 = Net sales for FY2018 + Change in net sales
  COGS for FY2019 = $386,064 + $83,758
  COGS for FY2019 = $469,822

However, this is not the correct way to calculate COGS. We need to use the statement of operations to find the correct COGS for FY2019.

Step 3: Calculate the COGS for FY2019 using the statement of operations.
- The statement of operations for FY2018 is not provided, but we can use the statement of operations for FY2019 to find the COGS.
- The statement of operations for FY2019 is not provided, but we can use the statement of operations for FY2020 to find the COGS for FY2019.
- The statement of operations for FY2020 is provided, and it shows the COGS for FY2020 as $233,307 million.

What is the FY2018 - FY2019 change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement). Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Give a solution to the question by using the P&L statement and the statement of cash flows.,3.1%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2018 - FY2019 change in unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Netflix. To calculate this, we need to first calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for both FY2018 and FY2019 using the unadjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization (D&A) from the cash flow statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for both FY2018 and FY2019. We can find the unadjusted operating income in the income statement and the D&A in the cash flow statement.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA, we need to add the unadjusted operating income and the D&A.

From the income statement for FY2018 and FY2019, we can find the unadjusted operating income:
- FY2018: $1,211,242
- FY2019: $5,116,228

From the cash flow statement for FY2018 and FY2019, we can find the D&A:
- FY2018: $83,157 + $7,532,088 + $41,212 = $7,656,457
- FY2019: $208,412 + $12,230,367 = $12,438,779

Now, we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA for both years:
- FY2018: $1,211,242 + $7,656,457 = $8,867,699
- FY2019: $5,116,228 + $12,438,779 = $17,555,007

To calculate the EBITDA % margin, we need to divide the unadjusted EBITDA by the revenue and multiply by 100. However, the revenue is not provided in the given context. We can use the net income as a proxy for revenue, but this will not be the actual EBITDA % margin. 

However, we can calculate the EBITDA % margin using the provided information. We will use the net income as a proxy for revenue.

"By drawing conclusions from the information stated only in the statement of income, what is the FY2018 SG&A (in USD millions) for Best Buy?",$8023.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The context is about the financial performance of Best Buy, including its gross profit rate, net sales, operating profit, dividend payments, and financing activities. The question asks for the FY2018 SG&A (Selling, General, and Administrative expenses) for Best Buy in USD millions.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide any information about the FY2018 SG&A for Best Buy. It only provides information about the financial performance of Best Buy in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, but not in 2018.

What is Walmart's FY2021 unadjusted operating income margin (as a percent of total revenue)? Please base your judgments on the information provided primarily in the P&L statement.,4.2%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for Walmart's FY2021 unadjusted operating income margin as a percent of total revenue, based on the information provided in the P&L statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the P&L statement for the fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, but it does not provide the P&L statement for the fiscal year 2021. However, it does provide the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018, which include the net income for each year.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the P&L statement for FY2021 is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the operating income margin for FY2021. However, we can look at the net income for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, which are provided in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The net income for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 are $15,080, $14,293, and $10,523 million, respectively.

However, to calculate the operating income margin, we need the total revenue for each year. Unfortunately, the total revenue is not provided in the given context. 

But we can look at the cash flows from operating activities, which is net income + non-cash items. The cash flows from operating activities for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 are $27,552, $31,673, and $28,337 million, respectively.

We can use the cash flows from operating activities to estimate the operating income margin for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, but not for FY2021.

The question asks for the FY2020 unadjusted EBITDA less capex for Boeing, which can be calculated using the information from the cash flow statement and the P&L statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the unadjusted EBITDA and capex for FY2020. The cash flow statement provides the depreciation and amortization, and the P&L statement provides the net loss. The question also defines unadjusted EBITDA as unadjusted operating income + depreciation and amortization.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the unadjusted EBITDA, we need to find the unadjusted operating income from the P&L statement. However, the P&L statement is not provided in the given context. We can only find the net loss, which is the opposite of the operating income. We can use the net loss to calculate the operating income by adding back the non-cash items from the cash flow statement.

From the cash flow statement for FY2020, we have:

- Net loss: ($11,941)
- Non-cash items:
  - Share-based plans expense: 212
  - Treasury shares issued for 401(k) contribution: 195
  - Depreciation and amortization: 2,271

The question is asking for Walmart's FY2021 unadjusted EBITDA, which can be calculated using the income statement and the statement of cash flows.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide information about Walmart's FY2021 financials directly. However, it does provide information about the company's current debt, funding plans, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. It also mentions that net sales and operating profit of business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the context does not provide information about FY2021, we cannot calculate the EBITDA for that year directly. However, we can look for any information that might be useful. The statement mentions that net cash used in financing activities decreased by $803 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by lower repayments of short-term borrowings and long-term debt of $773 million. This information is not directly useful for calculating EBITDA.

However, we can look at the information about the debt and funding plans. The context mentions that our debt totaled $57.0 billion as of December 31, 2022, and that approximately $14.5 billion of principal payments on outstanding debt will become due over the next three years. This information is also not directly useful for calculating EBITDA.

The context also mentions that our funding plan for the full year 2023 includes approximately $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion of unsecured term debt issuance and approximately $5.0 billion to $9.0 billion of secured term debt issuance. This information is also not directly useful for calculating EBITDA.

However, the context does not provide any information about the income statement for FY2021, which is necessary to calculate EBITDA. The statement of cash flows for FY2021 is also not provided.

Round answer to two decimal places.,0.65,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2016 dividend payout ratio for General Mills, which can be calculated using the total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the dividend payout ratio for FY2016. The income statement for FY2016 shows the net earnings attributable to General Mills, and the statement of cash flows for FY2016 shows the total cash dividends paid.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the dividend payout ratio, we need to divide the total cash dividends paid by the net income attributable to General Mills.

From the statement of cash flows for FY2016, the total cash dividends paid is $1,071.7 million.

From the income statement for FY2016, the net earnings attributable to General Mills is $1,697.4 million.

Dividend payout ratio = (Total cash dividends paid / Net income attributable to General Mills) * 100
= ($1,071.7 / $1,697.4) * 100
= 0.63

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The FY2016 dividend payout ratio for General Mills is 63.00%."

The question is asking for the net interest expense of American Water Works for FY2021, which is not directly provided in the given data. However, we can calculate it using the given data.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the income statement for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, which includes the interest expense for each year. We can use this information to calculate the net interest expense for FY2021.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the net interest expense for FY2021, we need to find the difference between the interest income and interest expense for FY2021. However, the interest income for FY2021 is not provided. We can calculate the interest income for FY2021 by finding the difference between the interest income for FY2020 and FY2019, and then adding it to the interest income for FY2019.

Interest income for FY2020: $49 million
Interest income for FY2019: $16 million
Interest income for FY2018: $20 million
Interest income for FY2021 = Interest income for FY2020 - Interest income for FY2019 + Interest income for FY2018
Interest income for FY2021 = $49 million - $16 million + $20 million
Interest income for FY2021 = $53 million

Now, we can calculate the net interest expense for FY2021 by subtracting the interest income from the interest expense for FY2020.
Interest expense for FY2020: $395 million
Net interest expense for FY2021 = Interest expense for FY2020 - Interest income for FY2021
Net interest expense for FY2021 = $395 million - $53 million
Net interest expense for FY2021 = $342 million

To convert the net interest expense from millions to billions, we divide by 1,000.
Net interest expense for FY2021 = $342 million / 1,000
Net interest expense for FY2021 = $0.342 billion

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The net interest expense for American Water Works's FY2021 is $0.342 billion."

The question asks for the three-year average of cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue from FY2019 to FY2021. However, the provided financial statements do not explicitly show the cost of goods sold. We can infer that the cost of goods sold is a part of the operating expenses, but it is not directly stated.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated statements of cash flows and balance sheets for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, but it does not provide the income statement for these years. However, we can infer that the net earnings are a part of the income statement, and we can use the information from the statement of cash flows to calculate the revenue.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
We can use the statement of cash flows to calculate the revenue for each year. The net earnings are the starting point, and we can add back the depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-operating items to get the operating income. However, we cannot directly calculate the cost of goods sold from the provided information.

To calculate the revenue, we can use the following steps:

- 2019: Net earnings = $6,230, Depreciation and amortization = $1,189, Stock-based compensation = $189, Deferred income taxes = $222, Severance and restructuring charges = -$96, Gain on property sale = -$51, Gain on divestiture of IS&GS business = -$73, Changes in assets and liabilities = $107, Contract assets = $378, Inventories = -$622, Accounts payable = -$1,098, Contract liabilities = $563, Postretirement benefit plans = $81, Income taxes = -$151, Other, net = $274. 
Revenue = Net earnings + Depreciation and amortization + Stock-based compensation + Deferred income taxes + Severance and restructuring charges + Gain on property sale + Gain on divestiture of IS&GS business + Changes in assets and liabilities + Contract assets + Inventories + Accounts payable + Contract liabilities + Postretirement benefit plans + Income taxes + Other, net = $6,230 + $1,189 + $189 + $222 - $96 - $51 - $73 + $107 + $378 - $622 - $1,098 + $563"

Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.",8.5%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the three-year average of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue from FY2019 to FY2021 for Johnson & Johnson.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated statements of cash flows and the consolidated statements of earnings for the years 2020, 2019, and 2022. The consolidated statements of cash flows provide the depreciation and amortization expense for each year, and the consolidated statements of earnings provide the revenue for each year.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the three-year average of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue, we need to first calculate the depreciation and amortization expense for each year and then divide it by the revenue for each year. We will then calculate the average of these percentages.

From the consolidated statements of cash flows, we can see that the depreciation and amortization expense for each year is as follows:

- 2020: $7,231 million
- 2019: $7,009 million
- 2018: $6,929 million

From the consolidated statements of earnings, we can see that the revenue for each year is as follows:

- 2020: $82,584 million
- 2019: $93,775 million
- 2018: $94,943 million

We will now calculate the depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue for each year:

- 2020: ($7,231 / $82,584) * 100% ≈ 8.8%
- 2019: ($7,009 / $93,775) * 100% ≈ 7.5%
- 2018: ($6,929 / $94,943) * 100% ≈ 7.3%

We will now calculate the average of these percentages:

(8.8 + 7.5 + 7.3) / 3 ≈ 7.9%

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The three-year average of depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue from FY2019 to FY2021 is approximately 7.9%."

The question asks for the three-year average of cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue from FY2015 to FY2017, based on the information provided in the income statement.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. However, the information needed to calculate the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is not directly available in the provided context. The context does mention that net sales and operating profit of the business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit, which are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment.

However, we can find the necessary information in the ""adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities"" section of the cash flow statement, which includes the change in inventories.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, we need to find the cost of goods sold and the revenue for each year. The cost of goods sold can be estimated by looking at the change in inventories, as the change in inventories is a component of the cost of goods sold.

From the ""adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities"" section, we can find the change in inventories for each year:

- 2016: (703) - (1,229) = -526
- 2015: (1,229) - (1,667) = -438
- 2014: (1,667) - (1,667) = 0

We can also find the net income from continuing operations for each year:

- 2016: $15,080
- 2015: $16,814
- 2014: $16,551

We can then estimate the revenue for each year by adding the net income from continuing operations to the depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and other operating activities:

- 2016: $15,080 + $9,454 + (-672) + $1,410 = $25,272
- 2015: $16,814 + $9,173 + (-503) + $785 = $"

What is the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Amazon? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement). Provide a response to the question by primarily using the cash flow statement and the income statement.,8.0%,"To calculate the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Amazon, we need to first calculate the unadjusted EBITDA using the unadjusted operating income and D&A (depreciation and amortization) from the cash flow statement.

From the cash flow statement, we can see that the total D&A for FY2015 is $6,281 million.

From the income statement, we can see that the operating income for FY2015 is $2,233 million.

Now, we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA by adding the operating income and D&A:

Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A
= $2,233 million + $6,281 million
= $8,514 million

Next, we need to calculate the total revenue for FY2015. From the income statement, we can see that the total net sales for FY2015 is $107,006 million.

Now, we can calculate the unadjusted EBITDA % margin by dividing the unadjusted EBITDA by the total revenue and multiplying by 100:

Unadjusted EBITDA % margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100
= ($8,514 million / $107,006 million) * 100
= 7.96%

Therefore, the FY2015 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Amazon is 7.96%."

What is the FY2019 - FY2021 unadjusted operating income 2 year CAGR for Amazon? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of income.,30.8%,"To calculate the FY2019 - FY2021 unadjusted operating income 2-year CAGR for Amazon, we need to first find the operating income for FY2019 and FY2021.

From the provided statement of operations, we can see that the operating income for FY2018 is $12,421 million and for FY2020 is $24,879 million. However, the operating income for FY2019 is not directly provided. We can calculate it by using the net income and the other income (expense) and interest income/expense.

For FY2019, the net income is $3,033 million, the other income (expense) is -$300 million, and the interest income is $202 million, and the interest expense is -$848 million. 

First, we calculate the total non-operating income (expense) for FY2019:
Total non-operating income (expense) = other income (expense) + interest income - interest expense
Total non-operating income (expense) = -$300 + $202 - (-$848) = $650 million

Then, we can calculate the operating income for FY2019:
Operating income = net income + total non-operating income (expense)
Operating income = $3,033 + $650 = $3,683 million

Now that we have the operating income for FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020, we can calculate the 2-year CAGR.

The formula for CAGR is:
CAGR = (end value / beginning value)^(1 / number of years) - 1

We will use the operating income for FY2018 as the beginning value and the operating income for FY2020 as the end value. The number of years is 2.

CAGR = ($24,879 / $12,421)^(1 / 2) - 1
CAGR = (2.0004)^(1 / 2) - 1
CAGR = 1.0673 - 1

Here's the question: what is Amcor's 2 year unadjusted operating income CAGR from FY2020 to FY2022 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)?,11.6%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the 2-year unadjusted operating income CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of Amcor from FY2020 to FY2022.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the income statements for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019. We can use this information to calculate the operating income for FY2020 and FY2021.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the 2-year unadjusted operating income CAGR, we need to first find the operating income for FY2020 and FY2021.

From the income statement for the year ended June 30, 2021:
Operating income = $1,321 million

From the income statement for the year ended June 30, 2020:
Operating income = $994 million

Next, we need to calculate the CAGR using the formula:
CAGR = (End value / Beginning value)^(1 / Number of years) - 1

In this case, the end value is the operating income for FY2021 ($1,321 million), the beginning value is the operating income for FY2020 ($994 million), and the number of years is 2.

CAGR = ($1,321 / $994)^(1 / 2) - 1
CAGR ≈ 0.032 or 3.2%

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
The 2-year unadjusted operating income CAGR of Amcor from FY2020 to FY2021 is 3.2%."
Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the P&L statement: what is PG&E's three year average of cost of goods sold as a % of revenue from FY2019 to FY2021? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.,21.6%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the three-year average of cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for PG&E from FY2019 to FY2021. However, the provided context does not contain information about PG&E's revenue or cost of goods sold for FY2019 and FY2020. It only provides information about FY2022.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
Since the context does not provide sufficient information about PG&E's revenue and cost of goods sold for FY2019 and FY2020, it is not possible to calculate the three-year average.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.

Assume that you are a public equities analyst. Answer the following question by primarily using information that is shown in the income statement: what is the FY2021 - FY2022 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square)? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.,-0.7%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the FY2021 - FY2022 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square), and I need to use information from the income statement to answer it.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context does not provide the total revenue for FY2021 and FY2022, but it does provide the provision for income taxes for both years. However, it also mentions that net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales, and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. This implies that the net sales are not directly provided, but the provision for income taxes might be related to the net income, which is derived from net sales.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the provision for income taxes is related to the net income, and the net income is derived from net sales, we can use the effective income tax rate to estimate the net income. The effective income tax rate is 23.1% for both FY2021 and FY2022. We can use this rate to calculate the net income for both years.

Let's denote the net income for FY2021 as NI2021 and the net income for FY2022 as NI2022. We can set up the following equations:

NI2021 = Provision for income taxes 2021 / Effective income tax rate
NI2022 = Provision for income taxes 2022 / Effective income tax rate

NI2021 = 6,802 / 0.231 = 29,512
NI2022 = 6,523 / 0.231 = 28,313

Now, we can calculate the total revenue for both years. Since the net income is derived from net sales, we can use the net income to estimate the net sales. However, we need to consider that the net income is not the only component of net sales. We also need to consider the cost of sales, which is not provided. But we can assume that the cost of sales is relatively stable from year to year, so we can use the net income to estimate the net sales.

Let's denote the net sales for FY2021 as NS2021 and the net sales for FY2022 as NS2022. We can set up the following equations:

NS2021"
"By relying on the line items plainly stated within the statement of income, what is the FY2019 - FY2021 total revenue 2 year CAGR for Intel? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place.",4.8%,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2019 - FY2021 total revenue 2-year Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for Intel, which can be found in the statement of income.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the CAGR, specifically the total revenue for FY2020 and FY2021.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
The total revenue for FY2020 is $723,875 million and for FY2021 is $772,005 million. To calculate the 2-year CAGR, we use the formula: CAGR = (New Value / Old Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1.

CAGR = ($772,005 / $723,875)^(1 / 2) - 1 ≈ 1.1%

Step 4: Only when you are sure of Step 3, Clearly state the final answer.
The FY2019 - FY2021 total revenue 2-year CAGR for Intel is 1.1%."
"By relying on the line items plainly stated within the cash flow statement, what is AES's FY2015 free cash flow (FCF)? FCF here is defined as: (cash from operations - capex). Answer in USD millions.",-$174.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for AES's FY2015 free cash flow (FCF) using the line items from the cash flow statement. FCF is defined as (cash from operations - capex).

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate FCF for FY2015. The cash flow statement for FY2015 has the following relevant line items: net cash provided by operating activities and capital expenditures.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate FCF, we need to subtract capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities for FY2015. 

Net cash provided by operating activities for FY2015 is $2,134 million.
Capital expenditures for FY2015 is $2,308 million.

FCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Capital expenditures
FCF = $2,134 million - $2,308 million
FCF = -$174 million

However, since FCF is typically a positive value, we need to re-examine the calculation. The correct calculation should be:

FCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Capital expenditures
FCF = $2,134 million - $2,308 million
FCF = -$174 million

But, we can also look at the investing activities section, which includes capital expenditures. The net cash used in investing activities for FY2015 is -$2,366 million. This includes capital expenditures of $2,308 million. However, the net cash used in investing activities also includes other items such as proceeds from the sale of businesses, net of cash sold, and sale of short-term investments. To get the correct FCF, we need to use the net cash provided by operating activities and the net cash used in investing activities.

Net cash provided by operating activities for FY2015 is $2,134 million.
Net cash used in investing activities for FY2015 is -$2,366 million.

FCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Net cash used in investing activities
FCF = $2,134 million - (-$2,366 million)
FCF = $2,134 million + $2,366 million
FCF = $4,500 million

However, this is not the correct FCF. We need to consider the definition of FCF, which is (cash from operations - capex). The correct FCF should"

The question asks for the FY2022 net working capital of Apple, which is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated balance sheets for Apple for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, but it does not provide the balance sheet for 2022. However, it does mention that as of December 31, 2022, Apple's debt totaled $57.0 billion.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the balance sheet for 2022 is not provided, we cannot directly calculate the net working capital for 2022. However, we can calculate the net working capital for 2019 and 2020 using the provided balance sheets.

For 2019:
Total current assets = $162,819 million
Total current liabilities = $105,718 million
Net working capital for 2019 = Total current assets - Total current liabilities
= $162,819 million - $105,718 million
= $57,101 million

For 2020:
Total current assets = $143,713 million
Total current liabilities = $105,392 million
Net working capital for 2020 = Total current assets - Total current liabilities
= $143,713 million - $105,392 million
= $38,321 million

However, we are asked for the FY2022 net working capital. Since the balance sheet for 2022 is not provided, we cannot calculate the net working capital for 2022 directly. But we can use the information that as of December 31, 2022, Apple's debt totaled $57.0 billion. We can also use the information that the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $534 million.

The question asks for the FY2016 return on assets (ROA) for Activision Blizzard, which is defined as FY2016 net income divided by the average total assets between FY2015 and FY2016.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the FY2016 net income and the total assets for FY2015 and FY2016.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the FY2016 ROA, we need to find the FY2016 net income and the average total assets between FY2015 and FY2016.

From the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, the FY2016 net income is $966 million.

The question asks for the depreciation and amortization expense in FY2019 for Block (formerly known as Square).

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the cash flow statement for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, which includes the depreciation and amortization expense for each year.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
The depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 is $84,212 thousand. To convert this to millions, we divide by 1,000: $84,212 / 1,000 = $84.212 million.

The depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 is $134,757 thousand. To convert this to millions, we divide by 1,000: $134,757 / 1,000 = $134.757 million.

The depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 is $340,523 thousand. To convert this to millions, we divide by 1,000: $340,523 / 1,000 = $340.523 million.

Since the question asks for the depreciation and amortization expense in FY2019, we do not have this information in the provided context. However, we can see that the depreciation and amortization expense increased from $84.212 million in 2020 to $134.757 million in 2021, and then to $340.523 million in 2022. We can assume that the depreciation and amortization expense in FY2019 was likely lower than in 2020, but we cannot determine the exact amount.

However, we can try to estimate the depreciation and amortization expense in FY2019 based on the trend of the increase in the expense from 2020 to 2022. The expense increased by $50.545 million from 2020 to 2021, and by $205.766 million from 2021 to 2022. We can assume a linear increase in the expense from 2020 to 2019, which would be a decrease of $50.545 million from 2020 to 2019. Therefore, the depreciation and amortization expense in FY2019 would be approximately $33.667 million ($84.212 million"

Provide a response to the question by primarily using the income statement and the cash flow statement.,1.1,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2020 retention ratio of Boeing, which can be calculated using the total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the retention ratio, including the total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders for FY2020.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
From the income statement, we can find the net income attributable to Boeing shareholders for FY2020, which is ($11,873) million.
From the cash flow statement, we can find the total cash dividends paid for FY2020, which is ($4,630) million.
The retention ratio can be calculated as follows:
Retention ratio = (Net income attributable to shareholders - Total cash dividends paid) / Net income attributable to shareholders
Retention ratio = (-$11,873 - (-$4,630)) / (-$11,873)
Retention ratio = (-$7,243) / (-$11,873)
Retention ratio = 0.61

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The FY2020 retention ratio for Boeing is 0.61."
What is Walmart's FY2016 inventory turnover ratio? Inventory turnover ratio is defined as: (FY2016 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2015 and FY2016). Round your answer to two decimal places. Provide a response to the question by primarily using the statement of financial position and the statement of income.,8.06,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for Walmart's FY2016 inventory turnover ratio, which is calculated as (FY2016 COGS) / (average inventory between FY2015 and FY2016). The inventory turnover ratio is a measure of how efficiently a company is using its inventory.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the inventory turnover ratio. The statement of income for FY2016 provides the cost of goods sold (COGS), and the statement of financial position for FY2015 and FY2016 provides the inventory amounts.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the inventory turnover ratio, we need to find the COGS for FY2016 and the average inventory between FY2015 and FY2016.

From the statement of income for FY2016, the COGS is not directly provided, but we can find it by looking at the table of contents, which mentions the consolidated statements of cash flows. The consolidated statements of cash flows for FY2016 show the cash flows from operating activities, which include the change in inventories. We can use this information to find the COGS.

The change in inventories for FY2016 is -703 million (inventories decreased by 703 million). The net income for FY2016 is 15,080 million. We can use the following formula to find the COGS:

COGS = Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization + Change in Inventories
COGS = 15,080 + 9,454 - 703
COGS = 23,831 million

The average inventory between FY2015 and FY2016 can be found by adding the inventories for FY2015 and FY2016 and dividing by 2.

Average Inventory = (44,269 + 44,435) / 2
Average Inventory = 44,352 million

Now, we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio:

Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory
Inventory Turnover Ratio = 23,831 / 44,352
Inventory Turnover Ratio = 0.537

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The final answer is 0.54."
"Basing your judgments off of the balance sheet, what is PepsiCo's year end FY2019 value of inventory (in USD thousands)?",$3339000.00,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking for the year-end value of inventory for PepsiCo in FY2019, based on the balance sheet.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the consolidated statement of cash flows for PepsiCo for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2019, December 29, 2018, and December 30, 2017. The statement of cash flows includes a section for operating activities, which includes a line item for ""change in assets and liabilities: inventories."" This line item shows the change in inventory from the beginning to the end of the year.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To find the year-end value of inventory for FY2019, we need to look at the ""change in assets and liabilities: inventories"" line item in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for FY2019. The line item shows a decrease in inventories of $190 million.

However, to find the year-end value of inventory, we need to look at the beginning of the year value of inventory. Unfortunately, the statement of cash flows does not provide the beginning of the year value of inventory. But we can find the beginning of the year value of inventory in the consolidated statement of equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020.

Step 4: Since the beginning of the year value of inventory for FY2019 is not available in the statement of cash flows, we will look at the consolidated statement of equity for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021, and December 26, 2020. However, the beginning of the year value of inventory for FY2019 is not available in the consolidated statement of equity either.

However, we can look at the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018. The statement of cash flows for FY2019 shows a decrease in inventories of $190 million.

Round your answer to two decimal places.",-60.57,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2020 cash conversion cycle (CCC) for Apple, which is defined as DIO + DSO - DPO. The definitions of DIO, DSO, and DPO are provided.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information for FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018, but not for FY2019 and FY2020. However, we can calculate the average of FY2017 and FY2018 to estimate the values for FY2019 and use the given information for FY2018 to estimate the values for FY2020.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate DIO, we need the average inventory between FY2017 and FY2018, and FY2018 COGS. The average inventory is (21,120 + 20,484) / 2 = 20,802. FY2018 COGS is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by subtracting the change in inventory from the beginning and end of the year from the net income. The change in inventory is 20,484 - 20,289 = 195. COGS is 59,531 + 32,590 = 92,121. However, this is not the correct COGS for FY2018, as it includes the depreciation and amortization. We need to subtract the depreciation and amortization from the net income to get the correct COGS. The depreciation and amortization is 10,903. The correct COGS is 59,531 - 10,903 = 48,628. Now we can calculate DIO: DIO = 365 * (20,802) / (48,628) = 183.45.

To calculate DSO, we need the average accounts receivable between FY2017 and FY2018, and FY2018 Revenue. The average accounts receivable is (20,484 + 20,289) / 2 = 20,386.5. FY2018 Revenue is not directly provided, but we can calculate it by adding the change in accounts receivable to the beginning and end of the year from the net income. The change in accounts receivable is 20,289 - 20,484 = -195. Revenue is 59,531 + 5,590 ="

Round your answer to two decimal places.",0.34,"Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question asks for the FY2021 asset turnover ratio of Oracle, which is defined as FY2021 revenue divided by the average total assets between FY2020 and FY2021. The context provides information about Oracle's financial statements, including the statement of cash flows and other financial data.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides the necessary information to calculate the FY2021 revenue and the average total assets between FY2020 and FY2021. The statement of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 provides the net income, which can be used to calculate the revenue. The consolidated statements of cash flows also provide the cash flows from operating activities, which can be used to calculate the total assets.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
To calculate the FY2021 asset turnover ratio, we need to find the FY2021 revenue and the average total assets between FY2020 and FY2021.

From the statement of cash flows, we can find the net income for FY2021, which is $13,746 million. However, this is not the revenue. We need to find the net sales, which is not directly provided in the statement of cash flows. We need to refer to the table of contents index to find the consolidated statements of income for the years ended May 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.

From the consolidated statements of income, we can find the net sales for FY2021, which is $43,841 million.

To calculate the average total assets between FY2020 and FY2021, we need to find the total assets for both years. We can use the statement of cash flows to find the changes in operating assets and liabilities, which can be used to calculate the total assets.

From the statement of cash flows, we can find the changes in operating assets and liabilities for both FY2020 and FY2021. We can then use these changes to calculate the total assets for both years.

For FY2020, the total assets can be calculated as follows:
- Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period: $20,514 million
- Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period: $37,239 million

The question is asking about the classification of PayPal's outstanding notes as short-term debt as of Q2 2023.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information about PayPal's debt as of December 31, 2022, and their funding plan for 2023, but it does not provide information about the classification of debt as of Q2 2023. However, it does provide information about the total debt as of December 31, 2022, and the principal payments due over the next three years.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
Since the context does not provide information about the classification of debt as of Q2 2023, we need to use the information about the principal payments due over the next three years to estimate the short-term debt. As of December 31, 2022, $14.5 billion of principal payments on outstanding debt will become due over the next three years. This implies that the remaining principal payments due in the next year (Q2 2023) would be approximately $4.83 billion ($14.5 billion / 3).

However, this is not the correct approach as we are looking for the amount of short-term debt as of Q2 2023, not the amount of principal payments due in the next year. The correct approach is to use the information about the total debt as of December 31, 2022, and the principal payments due over the next three years to estimate the short-term debt as of Q2 2023.

The total debt as of December 31, 2022, is $57.0 billion, and $14.5 billion of principal payments will become due over the next three years. This implies that the remaining principal payments due in the next three years would be approximately $14.5 billion. However, this is not the correct approach as we are looking for the amount of short-term debt as of Q2 2023, not the amount of principal payments due in the next three years.

The correct approach is to use the information about the total debt as of December 31, 2022, and the principal payments due over the next three years to estimate the short-term debt as of Q2 2023. However, the context does not provide information about the classification of debt as of Q2 2023,"

Step 1: Calculate DIO
- Average inventory between FY2021 and FY2022 = (Merchandise inventories FY2021 + Merchandise inventories FY2022) / 2 = (335 + 237) / 2 = 286
- FY2022 COGS = $94.9 billion (reported sales growth of 1.3% to $94.9 billion)
- DIO = 365 * (average inventory between FY2021 and FY2022) / (FY2022 COGS) = 365 * 286 / 94,900,000,000 = 1.38

Step 2: Calculate DSO
- Average accounts receivable between FY2021 and FY2022 = (Accounts receivable FY2021 + Accounts receivable FY2022) / 2 = (315 - 131) / 2 = 92
- FY2022 Revenue = $94.9 billion (reported sales growth of 1.3% to $94.9 billion)
- DSO = 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2021 and FY2022) / (FY2022 Revenue) = 365 * 92 / 94,900,000,000 = 0.37

Step 3: Calculate DPO
- Average accounts payable between FY2021 and FY2022 = (Accounts payable FY2021 + Accounts payable FY2022) / 2 = (196 + 47) / 2 = 121.5
- FY2022 COGS = $94.9 billion (reported sales growth of 1.3% to $94.9 billion)
- Change in inventory between FY2021 and FY2022 = Merchandise inventories FY2022 - Merchandise inventories FY2021 = 237 - 335 = -98
- DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2021 and FY2022) / (FY2022 COGS + change in inventory between FY2021 and FY2022) = 365 * 121.5 / (94,900,000,000 - 98,000,000) = 0.37

What is the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Amazon? Calculate unadjusted EBITDA using unadjusted operating income and D&A (from cash flow statement). Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the statement of cash flows.,11.2%,"To calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Amazon, we need to follow these steps:

1. Extract the FY2022 operating income from the statement of operations.
2. Extract the FY2022 depreciation and amortization (D&A) from the statement of cash flows.
3. Calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA by adding the operating income and D&A.
4. Calculate the FY2022 net sales from the statement of operations.
5. Calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA % margin by dividing the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA by the FY2022 net sales and multiplying by 100.

From the statement of operations, the FY2022 operating income is $12,248 million.

From the statement of cash flows, the FY2022 depreciation and amortization (D&A) is $41,921 million.

Now, let's calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA:
EBITDA = Operating Income + D&A
EBITDA = $12,248 + $41,921
EBITDA = $54,169 million

From the statement of operations, the FY2022 net sales is $513,983 million.

From the given context, we can find the operating income and net sales for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019. However, we are missing the data for FY2016.

Fortunately, we can find the missing data for FY2016 in the provided context. The context mentions the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. It also mentions the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. However, we can find the net income for FY2016 in the context of the consolidated statements of income for the 52 weeks ended August 30, 2020.

The net income for FY2016 is $4,059 million. We can use this data to find the net sales for FY2016.

From the consolidated statements of income for the 52 weeks ended August 30, 2020, we can see that the net income for FY2016 is $4,059 million and the net sales for FY2016 is $163,220 million.

Now, we can find the operating income for FY2016 by subtracting the provision for income taxes from the net income for FY2016. However, we don't have the provision for income taxes for FY2016. We can find the provision for income taxes for FY2016 in the context of the provision for income taxes year ended December 31, change 2022 2021 2020 2022 vs. 2021 (in thousands, except percentages) provision for income taxes $ 772,005 $ 723,875 $ 437,954 $ 48,130 7 % effective tax rate 15 % 12 % 14 %. However, the provision for income taxes is in thousands, so we need to convert it to millions.

The provision for income taxes for FY2016 is $437,954,000,000.

Now, we can find the operating income for FY2016 by subtracting the provision for income taxes from the net income for FY2016.

Operating income for FY2016 = Net income for FY2016 - Provision for income taxes for FY2016
= $4,059,000,000 - $437,954,000,"

Do cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive structuration of the demarcation membrane system in megakaryocytes?,"No. Background Blood platelet biogenesis results from the maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs), which involves the development of a complex demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, MK differentiation is an attractive model for studying membrane remodeling. Objectives We sought to investigate the mechanism of DMS structuration in relationship to the cytoskeleton. Results Using three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging, we have identified consecutive stages of DMS organization that rely on microtubule dynamics to polarize membranes and nuclei territories. Interestingly, F-actin is not involved in this process. We found that the mechanism underlying microtubule-dependent DMS formation required the activation of the guanosine triphosphate hydrolase Cdc42 and its p21-activated kinase effectors (Pak1/2/3). Förster resonance energy transfer demonstrated that active Cdc42 was associated with endomembrane dynamics throughout terminal maturation. Inhibition of Cdc42 or Pak1/2/3 severely destructured the DMS and blocked proplatelet formation. Even though this process does not require containment within the hematopoietic niche, because DMS structuration was observed upon thrombopoietin-treatment in suspension, integrin outside-in signaling was required for Pak activation and probably resulted from secretion of extracellular matrix by MKs. Conclusions These data indicate a functional link, mandatory for MK differentiation, between microtubule dynamics, regulated by Cdc42/Pak1/2/3, and DMS maturation.","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.

how are forest fires beneficial to conifers like jack pines?,"Based on the provided passages, forest fires are beneficial to conifers like jack pines in several ways:

1. Fire helps to clear the way for new growth by consuming dead, decaying vegetation on the forest floor, creating a clean slate for seed germination and seedling establishment (Passage 2).
2. Jack pine seeds are adapted to fire, as they are stored in serotinous cones that only open after a fire has melted the resin holding them closed. This allows the seeds to disperse and establish new populations (Passage 2).
3. Fire can create a favorable environment for jack pine and aspen regrowth by reducing competition from other tree species, such as spruce, which have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees (Passage 3).

Therefore, forest fires can benefit jack pines by providing a means of seed dispersal and creating conditions that promote their growth and regeneration.","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.

how do you process the air you breathe before it gets to your lungs?,"Based on the provided passages, the process of processing the air we breathe before it reaches the lungs involves the following steps:

1. The diaphragm muscle contracts to take air into the lungs, moving down from the bottom of the rib cage towards the abdominal region. (Passage 1)
2. The process of breathing involves the exchange of gases between the body and the outside environment, occurring in the lungs. (Passage 2)
3. Increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity, including the lungs, decreases the air pressure in the lungs below the atmospheric pressure, forcing air from the atmosphere into the lungs, causing us to inhale. (Passage 3)

Therefore, the main steps in processing the air we breathe before it reaches the lungs are:

1. Contraction of the diaphragm muscle to draw air into the lungs.
2. Exchange of gases between the body and the outside environment in the lungs.
3. Expansion of the thoracic cavity to decrease air pressure in the lungs and facilitate inhalation.

Unable to answer based on given passages.","Step 1: Carefully read and understand the context and the question.
The question is asking about the process of air before it reaches the lungs.

Step 2: Analyze whether the context provides sufficient information to answer the question.
The context provides information about the process of breathing, including the movement of the diaphragm, intercostal muscles, and the exchange of gases in the lungs. It also mentions the role of the respiratory system in providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide.

Step 3: Use the information in the context to calculate or determine the correct answer.
From passage 2 of the first set of passages, when you inhale: 
1. The intercostal muscles contract, expanding the ribcage.
2. The diaphragm contracts, pulling downwards to increase the volume of the chest.
3. Pressure inside the chest is lowered and air is sucked into the lungs.

From passage 3 of the first set of passages, when you breathe, the outside air pushes into your windpipe (trachea) into your lungs. When there is a hole in the chest wall, the outside air can come in through that hole.

From passage 3 of the second set of passages, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity drags along with it the lungs, which increases the volume of the lungs, which causes a decrease in the air pressure in the lungs below the atmospheric pressure, forcing air from the atmosphere into the lungs, causing you to inhale.

Step 4: Clearly state the final answer.
The air you breathe is processed by the intercostal muscles contracting to expand the ribcage, the diaphragm contracting to increase the volume of the chest, and the outside air pushing into the windpipe (trachea) into the lungs, causing a decrease in air pressure in the lungs below the atmospheric pressure, forcing air from the atmosphere into the lungs."
