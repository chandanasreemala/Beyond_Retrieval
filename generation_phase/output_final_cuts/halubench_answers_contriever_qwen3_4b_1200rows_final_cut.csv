How does PEDV spread?,fecal-oral contact,covidqa,"PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact.

The context provides sufficient information to answer the question. PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact. This mode of transmission allows the virus to be passed from infected piglets to other pigs, especially when the virus is present in feces and ingested by other animals. Once internalized, it damages the intestinal lining, leading to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and death in piglets. PEDV is a highly contagious swine disease that affects young piglets, with up to 100% mortality within 24 hours of infection. The virus belongs to the alphacoronavirus genus and has a large genome size, which contributes to its ability to evolve and adapt. Despite the existence of vaccines in some countries, there is currently no approved vaccine in the United States or Europe. The virus continues to evolve within the U.S. swine population, which may impact control strategies. PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact. This transmission route is critical in understanding how the virus spreads in swine populations and why it is so deadly to young piglets. The virus destroys the intestinal lining, leading to malabsorption of nutrients, resulting in dehydration and starvation. The high mortality rate in piglets underscores"

"Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?",the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is perfect. The virus is not present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.,covidqa,"Step 1: The question asks whether oral swabs are sufficient for detecting 2019-nCOV infection.  
Step 2: The context discusses that oral swabs were used for molecular diagnosis and were used to release patients upon two negative detections. However, it also notes that 2019-nCOV can be shed through oral–fecal routes and that anal swabs showed more positives than oral swabs in later stages of infection. This suggests that oral swabs may not be sufficient for detecting infection in all stages.  
Step 3: The context indicates that while oral swabs were used for diagnosis and patient release, the presence of the virus in anal swabs and blood, especially in later stages, suggests that oral swabs alone may not be sufficient for comprehensive detection.  
Step 4: Oral swabs are not sufficient for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, as the virus can also be shed through the fecal route and detected in anal swabs, particularly in later stages of infection.

How many points did the Patriots win the game by?,"20, 20",drop,"The context does not provide sufficient information to answer the question. 

Reason: The question asks for the point difference in a game where the Patriots won, but the contexts describe multiple games (against the Bills, Packers, and Bengals) with different scores. While one context mentions a ""37-16 win over the Buffalo Bills,"" this specific game's point difference (37 - 16 = 21) could be inferred. However, the question does not specify which game is being referred to, and the contexts do not clearly indicate that this is the game in question.

Final Answer: The context does not provide sufficient information to answer the question. 

(Note: If the intended game was the 37-16 win over the Bills, the Patriots won by 21 points. But since the question does not specify which game, the answer remains uncertain.)

Do cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive structuration of the demarcation membrane system in megakaryocytes?,"No. Background Blood platelet biogenesis results from the maturation of megakaryocytes (MKs), which involves the development of a complex demarcation membrane system (DMS). Therefore, MK differentiation is an attractive model for studying membrane remodeling. Objectives We sought to investigate the mechanism of DMS structuration in relationship to the cytoskeleton. Results Using three-dimensional (3D) confocal imaging, we have identified consecutive stages of DMS organization that rely on microtubule dynamics to polarize membranes and nuclei territories. Interestingly, F-actin is not involved in this process. We found that the mechanism underlying microtubule-dependent DMS formation required the activation of the guanosine triphosphate hydrolase Cdc42 and its p21-activated kinase effectors (Pak1/2/3). Förster resonance energy transfer demonstrated that active Cdc42 was associated with endomembrane dynamics throughout terminal maturation. Inhibition of Cdc42 or Pak1/2/3 severely destructured the DMS and blocked proplatelet formation. Even though this process does not require containment within the hematopoietic niche, because DMS structuration was observed upon thrombopoietin-treatment in suspension, integrin outside-in signaling was required for Pak activation and probably resulted from secretion of extracellular matrix by MKs. Conclusions These data indicate a functional link, mandatory for MK differentiation, between microtubule dynamics, regulated by Cdc42/Pak1/2/3, and DMS maturation.",pubmedqa,"Step 1: The question asks whether cdc42-dependent F-actin dynamics drive the structuration of the demarcation membrane system (DMS) in megakaryocytes.

Does calcyclin mediate serum response element ( SRE ) activation by an osteoblastic extracellular cation-sensing mechanism?,"Yes. We identified calcyclin (S100A6), a calcium-binding protein of the EF-hand type belonging to the S100 family, as being responsible for transferring a cation-sensing response from osteoblasts to COS-7 cells. Transfection of the calcyclin cDNA into COS-7 and HEK-293 cells confirmed that the overexpression of calcylin caused these cells to gain the ability to sense extracellular cations, including aluminum, gadolinium, calcium, and magnesium. Conversely, we found that an antisense calcyclin construct reduced calcyclin expression and partially inhibited the cation-sensing response in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts.

how do crab traps work,"Based on the given passages, here's how crab traps work:

Crab traps are large square structures made of wire or flat metal mesh, with two ends that angle into the trap from the sides and bottom, leading to a narrow slit about 2 feet into the pot. This slit is the only entrance into the trap. Crabs are attracted to bait inside the pot and must crawl up the leads to reach it, but once they enter, they cannot escape due to the narrow opening. The pot is designed to allow crabs in but not let them out, making it an effective tool for catching crabs.

how to sew a zipper gusset,"To sew a zipper gusset, start by tracing all patterns to the fabric and cutting it out. Start by making a zipper sandwich, which involves placing a piece of lining fabric face up, then the zipper, and then the outer fabric right side facing down. Line up all three edges. Then, using a zipper foot, sew across the top between the edge of your zipper sandwich and the zipper teeth. Repeat this for the other side of the zipper. Pin the zipper gusset to the zipper about 1/4"" away from the center with the right sides facing each other. Sew a line near the seam line to secure the position. Place the zipper gusset lining on top of them with the right side facing down and stitch on the seam line. Flip the lining to the bottom of the main zipper gusset and top stitch near the seam line. Repeat on the other side. The width of the zipper between the gussets should measure 1/2"". Change the presser foot back to a normal foot and stitch on the seam allowance around the zipper gusset. This should attach the main and lining fabric together nicely. Finally, place the zipper gusset onto the main body of the item you're sewing, aligning the ends to the center markings and sew from marking to marking at both ends. Place the lining on top of them with the right side facing down.",ragtruth,"The context does not provide sufficient information to answer the question.

how to get antique effect on wood using normal paint,"Based on the provided passages, here are some steps to achieve an antique effect on wood using normal paint:

1. Apply a basecoat of flat or satin paint to the wood surface ( passage 3). Satin paint is easier to work with, but flat paint will give a more aged look.
2. Mix paint that is two shades darker than the basecoat with an equal amount of glaze ( passage 3). Once the basecoat is dry, drizzle a crumpled rag or plastic bag in the glaze mixture to achieve an aged appearance.
3. Layer stain on top of the paint to create a cool effect ( passage 1). This technique involves applying multiple layers of stain and allowing them to dry between coats.
4. Use a palette knife to spread a mixture of molding paste and a rust or dull color on a canvas, letting it dry before adding additional layers ( passage 2). This can help create an embossed design with an antique finish.
5. Apply a thin layer of burnt sienna or a similar color to give the wood a vintage look ( passage 3). Dabbing the paint with a paper towel or cloth can help remove excess paint and achieve a more subtle, aged appearance.

what is a transistor how does it work,"Based on the provided passages, here is how a transistor works:

1. A transistor functions as both an amplifier and a switch.
2. The transistor's design allows it to control a larger supply of electricity with a small amount of electricity, much like turning a valve to control a supply of water.
3. The base of the transistor pulls electrons from the emitter, creating a flow of electricity through the transistor.
4. The transistor can take in a tiny electric current at one end (the input current) and produce a much bigger electric current at the other end (the output current) when it works as an amplifier.
5. The holes in the base of the transistor act as a barrier, preventing any significant current flow from the emitter to the collector when the transistor is in its off state.
6. When the electrons and holes move across the two junctions between the n-type and p-type silicon, the transistor begins to work.
7. The collector current is approximately beta (common-emitter current gain) times the base current, and it is typically greater than 100 for small-signal transistors but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications.

how are forest fires beneficial to conifers like jack pines?,"Based on the provided passages, forest fires are beneficial to conifers like jack pines in several ways:

1. Fire helps to clear the way for new growth by consuming dead, decaying vegetation on the forest floor, creating a clean slate for seed germination and seedling establishment (Passage 2).
2. Jack pine seeds are adapted to fire, as they are stored in serotinous cones that only open after a fire has melted the resin holding them closed. This allows the seeds to disperse and establish new populations (Passage 2).
3. Fire can create a favorable environment for jack pine and aspen regrowth by reducing competition from other tree species, such as spruce, which have better access to sunlight while shading the other trees (Passage 3).

what happens when you breath in and out,"Based on the given passages, here is what happens when you breathe in and out:

When you breathe in (inhalation):

* The intercostal muscles contract, causing the ribcage to expand.
* The diaphragm contracts, pulling downwards to increase the volume of the chest.
* Pressure inside the chest is lowered, allowing air to be sucked into the lungs.

When you breathe out (exhalation):

* The diaphragm relaxes and moves upward into the chest cavity.
* The intercostal muscles relax, reducing the space in the chest cavity.
* Air rich in carbon dioxide is forced out of the lungs and windpipe, and then out of the nose or mouth.

how are forest fires beneficial to conifers like jack pines?,"Based on the given passages, it appears that forest fires are beneficial to conifers like jack pines because they help to clear away dead vegetation and promote new growth. According to passage 2, the jack pine produces serotonous cones that are dormant until a fire occurs, at which point they melt and release their seeds. This suggests that fire is a mechanism for the dispersal of jack pine seeds, and that the tree relies on fires to spread its seeds. Additionally, passage 3 suggests that while spruce trees may outcompete jack pine and aspen in some areas, fires can disrupt this cycle and allow jack pine and aspen to regain an advantage.
